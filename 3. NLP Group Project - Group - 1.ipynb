If you're going to require updating your firmware, at least do it when it's convenient instead of right before a workout. The actual process of updating is terrible. Constantly hanging and needing to restart the process with no indication with what's wrong or how to fix it. Even after it actually updated successfully, it wouldn't let me use the app because it thought I still needed to update until I rebooted. The entire process took hours, multiple restarts of both my fitbit and my phone, one factory reset, and multiple firmware upgrades. The clock face browser sucks. The search is bare bones (no tags for searching complications). Half the weather faces don't work because of a change in Yahoo Weather API (because fitbit don't offer their own to third-party developers?) and there's no way to tell until you get through the laborious clock face install process... and since there's no bookmark system, you have to manually refind the least bad one you found 30 minutes ago. Pairing also sucks. To get music controls, you need to go through a confusing extra bluetooth pairing separate from the normal process and it constantly breaks. Exercise support for anything but cardio sucks. Lifters get no rep tracking or even type of lifting. There aren't that many activities to choose from and no way to make your own. Sleep tracking is fine but the alarms are basic. There's not a system to wake you within a specified period if you're in a light sleep state. Even normal phone apps can do this, and they don't have heartbeat data to help. Overall, using the fitbit and the app is just a miserable experience. You're never quite sure what state things are in, whether WiFi is working, which types of pairing is active, if you're even connected, if music controls are available... the product and the app feels like a knockoff rather than what is supposedly a big player in the market.\",\n",
